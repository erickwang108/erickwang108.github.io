Insertion Sort assumes that array is divided in two parts:
Sorted (Initially the first element)
Unsorted
Each pass, we select an element, and check it against the sorted array.
If the selected element is smaller than the last element of the sorted array then we shift the sorted array by 1 until we find the spot to insert the selected element.
Insertion sort in action - source 111
Time comlexity of Insertion sort is of O(n2).
Itâ€™s a stable algorithm.
